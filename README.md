**Introduction**
Agriculture is a major source of income and employment in India. The most prevalent problem faced by Indian farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop for their land. The project aims to analyze the performance of various Machine Learning algorithms that provides recommendations to farmers on the most suitable crop to cultivate based on the soil and weather conditions like temperature , humidity, rainfall, Nitrogen , Potassium, Phosphorus and Ph value of the soil. This work analyzes various Machine Learning classifier algorithms to analyze accuracy of soil properties , climate and other relevant factors to generate personalized crop recommendations for each farmer
**Objective **
-To find the best performing model to recommend the most suitable crops based on environmental factors and soil conditions.

Prediction Criteria:
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Temperature, Humidity, pH
- Rainfall

The user interface of the Agri Crop Advisor website is displayed. The landing page welcomes users to the Crop Recommendation System, offering two primary functionalities: "Crop Prediction" and "Crop Recommendation." A helpful tips banner for farmers runs across the top, providing guidance on essential farming practices. 

**ABOUT PAGE **

The Crop Prediction Page allows users to input essential soil and weather data, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Based on these inputs, the system predicts the most suitable crop for the given conditions. It has a Predict Crop button, by clicking user can navigate to the Result page . By clicking the Return to Home Page link the user can navigate to the Home Page.

The Crop Recommendation Page allows users to input essential soil data such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium , humidity and PH value. And we also need to give the particular state and district , based on these inputs, an API(Open weather API) is called to get the  average of previous 3 months weather conditions like temperature and rainfall to predicts the most suitable crops for the given conditions

The Crop Recommendation Result Page displays the predicted crops based on user input soil and weather condition of that particular State and District.  And it has a Recommend  Again button, by clicking that button user can navigate back to the Crop Recommendation Page.

 **Conclusion **
The Crop Recommendation System project aims to provide a robust tool for farmers and agricultural experts, enhancing decision-making through data-driven crop recommendations. By integrating machine learning and environment  data analysis, the system promotes sustainable farming practices, increases agricultural productivity and supports the global food supply chain.
